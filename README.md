## Hello ü§üüèº!
My name is **Rodrigo Garc√≠a** and I'm a **Creative Developer** which means I do *front-end and back-end* focused with **Javascript** but also do *UI/UX design*. I'm also a Digital Artist, Digital Invader, gamer, musician, early adopter and tech entusiastic. I like to always learn new things and keep in touch with new trends and practices. I can assume the leadership when needed and confident of my skills and knowledge.
